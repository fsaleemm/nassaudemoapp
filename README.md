# Search Demo App

This is a demo application that is intended to be an illustration of how to index the output of the S2T data generated by the [solution accelerator](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-speech-sdk/blob/master/samples/batch/batch-ingestion-client/Setup/guide.md). The search application will display top 100 search results and sample filters for demonstrating the search of the S2T transcription.

The following components will be deployed to your resource group.

The diagram below shows the architecture.

1. The blob container that has the output from the S2T solution accelerator.
1. The Azure Cognitive Search service is used to create an indexer to provide search capability for the JSON files create by S2T solution accelerator. 
1. A Web App service is used to deploy the custom search application.

## High Level Setup Steps

1. Deploy the components using the Deploy to Azure button above.
1. Copy the [sample data](/searchqueryapp/SampleData) into the searchsource blob container. This container simulates the output storage container of the S2T solution accelerator.
1. Follow instruction on [How to index JSON blobs using a Blob indexer in Azure Cognitive Search](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/search-howto-index-json-blobs#:~:text=Parsing%20modes%20%20%20%20parsingMode%20%20,mode%20if%20your%20blobs%20consist%20o%20..., "") to index JSON in the SampleData folder.
    1. For Step 3 in instructions, select Parsing mode as JSON, and the searchsource storage container.
    2. For step 5 in instructions, set index attributes as specified in the screenshot shown below:

1. Enable Authentication on the App Service. For simplicity [create new app registration automatically](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/configure-authentication-provider-aad#-create-a-new-app-registration-automatically)
1. [Get the Search Service Endpoint and Key](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/search-semi-structured-data#get-a-key-and-url) and fill in the the endpoint url and the api key. The index name is set in the indexer creation step above.

  ```json
  [
    {
      "name": "SearchIndexName",
      "value": "<Index Name>",
      "slotSetting": false
    },
    {
      "name": "SearchServiceEndpoint",
      "value": "<EndPoint URL>",
      "slotSetting": false
    },
    {
      "name": "SearchServiceQueryApiKey",
      "value": "<API Key>",
      "slotSetting": false
    }
  ]
  ```

6. Add the [configurations to the App Service.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/configure-common#edit-in-bulk).
1. Lauch the app.

Disclaimer: This is a sample application with rudimentary error/exception handling and no unit testing. It is intended as an illustration/demo and not for production use.
